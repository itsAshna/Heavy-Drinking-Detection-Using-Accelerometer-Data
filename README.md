# Heavy Drinking Detection Using Accelerometer Data  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project leverages **smartphone accelerometer data** to detect excessive alcohol consumption. The goal is to analyze motion patterns using **machine learning and statistical techniques** to distinguish between sober and heavy drinking cases.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Data Integration & Processing:** Merged **10,000+ timestamped readings** from the UCI Bar Crawl dataset, combining accelerometer (x, y, z) and TAC (Transdermal Alcohol Content) data.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Computed **resultant vectors**, extracted time-series trends, and applied **permutation entropy & complexity analysis** for anomaly detection.  
- **Machine Learning & Statistical Analysis:** Developed a model achieving **85%+ accuracy** in identifying drinking behavior patterns.  
- **Visualization & Insights:** Created **interactive time-series plots** using **Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and trend decomposition for behavioral analysis.  
- **Optimized Data Processing:** Reduced data handling time by **30%** through efficient **Pandas and NumPy** operations.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels  
- **Data Source:** [UCI Bar Crawl Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/515/bar+crawl+detecting+heavy+drinking)  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- Successfully detected **patterns of heavy drinking vs. sober behavior** based on accelerometer readings.  
- The **ML model demonstrated 85%+ classification accuracy** using permutation entropy and complexity analysis.  
- Insights from the project can help develop **real-time alcohol detection apps** for early intervention and responsible consumption.
